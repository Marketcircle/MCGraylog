# Contributing to MCGraylog

First, let me thank you for wanting to contribute! :)

There are no contributions that are too small. Even if you are only fixing
typos, adding documentation, or some example code. The goal is to make the 
process simple and as painless as possible to encourage contributions.

The best way to submit contributions is through a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on the
[Github page](https://github.com/Marketcircle/MCGraylog), though email is
also acceptable if privacy is a concern or Github is too much of hassle.
Emails can be sent to [Thomas Bartelmess](mailto://tbartelmess@marketcircle.com).

Unless otherwise requested, commit history will always be made to reflect
who made the contribution.


## Bugs

If you think you've found a bug, feel free to log the issue. Duplicates
are OK, they will be closed as duplicates with pointers to the original
issue. 

You should try to check if the bug you've reported has already been
fixed or obsoleted on the master branch.


## Code

Try to stick within the existing style (:laughing:). The importance of
sticking with existing style grows linearly with the size of the
contribution.

It is preferred that code contributions, whether they are new features or
bug fixes, be accompanied by test(s) showing that the relevant code works.
As with coding style, the importance of tests depends on the size of the
changes you wish to submit.


## Documentation and Examples

Go for it. :bowtie:
